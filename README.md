# RentalApp
:house_with_garden: Creating a Rental App to reduce the burden that comes with finding a rental or tenant. :houses:

# Introduction
:car: Welcome to Vroom :car: 

During the next 12 weeks the Vroom Development ream will be creating a house rental application. We will be documenting the experience so that others learn from our experiences.

# Front End Instructions
The front end of our application is React.

# Back End Instructions
The back end of our application is Express and MongoDB. We decided on using typescript as the language of choice instead of javascript. However, typescript will transpile this into javascript for us. This file will be generated in the "dist" inside the express-rental-backend directory. Change directories to express-rental-backend and run the command below.

```sh
npm run dev
```

# Additional Information :books:
Scripts can be found in package.json. :closed_book:
Typescript configurations can be found in tsconfig.ts :green_book:

Feel free to play with codes, if you have a crazy idea, then please create a pull request :)
